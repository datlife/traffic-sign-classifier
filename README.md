## Traffic Sign Recognition Program
### Overview

In this project, I used  deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. I have trained a model inspired by VGG-Net so it can decode traffic signs from natural images by using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). 

After the model is trained, user can test on new images of traffic signs you find on the web, or, if you're feeling adventurous pictures of traffic signs you find locally!

### Dependencies

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
- [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org)
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) (Optional)

Run this command at the terminal prompt to install [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/). Useful for image processing:

- `conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3`

### Dataset

1. [Download the dataset](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/581faac4_traffic-signs-data/traffic-signs-data.zip). This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32.
2. Clone the project and start the notebook.
```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Signs
cd CarND-Traffic-Signs
jupyter notebook Traffic_Signs_Recognition.ipynb
```
3. Follow the instructions in the `Traffic_Signs_Recognition.ipynb` notebook.
